# Tools-for-Data-Science

## Module 4: Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab
- Intro to Jupyter Notebooks
- Getting started with Jupyter
- Lab4a: Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks
- **Jupyter Kernels**
- Lab4b: Using **Markdown** in Jupyter Notebooks
- **Jupyter Architecture** (Reading 4a)
- Lab4c: Working with files in Jupyter Notebooks
- Additional **Anaconda Jupyter Environments**: JupyterLab and VS Code (creating and modifying Jupyter Notebooks in a local device)
  - **Anaconda Navigator GUI**
  - Anaconda Navigator - **JupyterLab** :
  - **VS Code** installation (locally)
  - Anaconda Navigator - VS Code 
- Additional **Cloud Based Jupyter Environments**: JupyterLite and GoogleColaboratory (cloud based environments used to create and modify Jupyter Notebooks)
  - **JupyterLite**: Launch JupyterLite
    - Lightweight tool built from JupyterLab components ​that executes entirely in the browser.​
    - Does not require a dedicated Jupyter server. ​
    - Only a web server is required, which means ​we can deploy JupyerLite as a static website.​
    - We can also use it to create interactive graphics and visualizations because it supports many visualization libraries like Altair, Plotly, and ipywidgets​.
    - Since it is a distribution of JupyterLab, ​it includes the latest improvements and features.​
  - **GoogleColab**: Explore GoolgeColab
    - Execute on a browser
    - Projects are stored on Google Drive and GitHub.
    - Upload and share notebooks without setup and installation.​
    - Clone projects from GitHub and execute them in GoogleColab.​
    - Most machine learning and visualization libraries are pre-installed, like scikit-learn and matplotlib.​
    - You can develop many trending data science applications “on the fly”, which is to say, quickly without a lot of setup or preparation.​
- Lab4d: Download & Install Anaconda on Windows
- Jupyter Notebooks on the Internet
