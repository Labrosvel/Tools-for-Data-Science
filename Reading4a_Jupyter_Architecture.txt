Welcome to “Jupyter Architecture.” After watching this video, you will be able to describe the basic Jupyter architecture, and explain Jupyter architecture for
conversion of a file format. Jupyter architecture implements a
two-process model with a kernel and a client. The client is the interface offering the
user the ability to send code to the kernel. It is the browser in a Jupyter Notebook. The kernel executes the code and returns
the result to the client for display. Jupyter Notebooks represent your
code, metadata, contents, and outputs. When you save the Notebook, it is sent
from your browser to the Notebook server. It saves the notebook file
on a disk as a JSON file with a .ipynb (pronounced as dot i PI NB) extension. The Notebook server is responsible
for saving and loading the notebooks. And the kernel executes the cells of code contained
in the Notebook when the user runs them. The Jupyter architecture uses the NB convert
tool to convert files to other formats. For example, if we want to convert a notebook
file into an HTML file, the notebook is first modified by a preprocessor, then an exporter
converts the notebook to the new file format. Finally, a postprocessor will work on the
exported file to give the final output. After conversion, on giving the url
of the file, the HTML file displays. In this video, you learned that: Jupyter implements a two-process
